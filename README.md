Horiseon is a fictional company that aids other fictional companies in marketing and general publicity in the realm of the internet. Horiseon took a turn for the worse when in August of 2002, founder and CEO, Dirk Von Dillinghall decided to take a 30 year sabbatical to the island nation of Mariokapolous in the Aegaean sea. He left his son, Virk Von Dillinghall to run the family business in his absence, which was a poor decision. Virk Von Dillinghall was weak to the pleasures of the flesh and destroyed all credibility to his father's once proud fictional company, leaving it up to students at a bootcamp to clean up the coding on the website.
